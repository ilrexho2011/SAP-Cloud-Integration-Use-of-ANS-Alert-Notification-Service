# SAP-Cloud-Integration-Use-of-ANS-Alert-Notification-Service
SAP Alert Notification service offers a common API for providers to publish alerts and for consumers to subscribe to these alerts. It is designed to automatically send real-time notifications and alerts about events that may be of interest to the business and operations. This approach consolidates failed interface alerts into structured, interface-specific emails, reducing email spam while ensuring timely notifications. Value Mapping enables dynamic recipient assignment and the Records Per Email parameter prevents excessive email length. Additionally, handling critical interfaces separately is a suggested enhancement to avoid duplicate notifications.
